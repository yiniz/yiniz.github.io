For me, conducting social science research means much more than finding answers to interesting questions. I believe that social science research should aim at improving the wellbeing of society by generating socially relevant knowledge and sharing it with the general public. I strive to do so through my own research.

* I have shared my research indirectly through the media, particularly with [my paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/jcmc/zmz009) concerning how Twitter responded to mass shootings between 2012 and 2014. That paper shows different temporal patterns of gun rights and gun control discourses as well as differential response based on features of mass shootings (e.g.,race of victims and shooter). We shared initial results of this paper through [Washington Post's Monkey Cage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/02/20/why-social-media-appeals-after-mass-shootings-have-done-little-to-change-gun-laws/?fbclid=IwAR1tnTttjem8UrYPPKxtqgJNj1hrfQnWCishTOGl56ZfSNVYFXJfEN4yxA4). After the paper was published, [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel](https://www.jsonline.com/restricted/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jsonline.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Felections%2F2019%2F06%2F21%2Fstudy-responses-mass-shootings-finds-gun-rights-side-winning%2F1522977001%2F) ran an article introducing the findings. I also shared our findings in an interview with [Wisconsin Public Television](https://www.pbs.org/video/post-shooting-sentiments-intense-they-are-fleeting/).

* A project that I was a core member of looks at how Russian disinformation actors infiltrated into American media. It was featured in [Columbia Journalism Review]( https://www.cjr.org/analysis/tweets-russia-news.php) by our amazing project leads. Excitingly, this article was referenced in [Robert Muellerâ€™s 2018 report (p. 27)]( https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf).


* As a research assistant for Professor Rohe of the Department of Statistics, I was involved in a project that locates the elite layer of the political Twitter and tracks their activity over time. I created a system for producing the website [murmuration.wisc.edu]( https://murmuration.wisc.edu) that displays daily chatter of different Twitter flocks. Whoever is interested in understanding Twitter and politics can explore this project on their own through this website.
