My research concerns how the abundance and interconnectedness of the digital media system shape the shifting communication ecology. My current research program consists of three parts: 1) how actors drive attention toward and thus amplify a certain object; 2) how citizen expression on social media interacts with other parts of the media system; and 3) how computational techniques can be harnessed and developed to facilitate communication research.
